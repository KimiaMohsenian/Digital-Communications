# Digital-Communications

I took digital communications course at university in fall semester 2022-23. 

In our final project, we were supposed to implement a digital communication system with AWGN channel and QPSK modulation, then transmit an input audio through this system once with a coherent and once with a non-coherent receiver. BER for different SNR were required.
