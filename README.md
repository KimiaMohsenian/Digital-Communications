# Digital-Communications

I tool digital communications course at university in fall semester 2022-23. 
In our final project, we were supposed to implenet a digital communication system with AWGN channel, transmit an input audio through this system once with coherent QPSK modulation and once with a non-coherent QPSK modulation.
